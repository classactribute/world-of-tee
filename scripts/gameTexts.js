    start: "Welcome, traveler. This is my interactive portfolio. A world I’ve been building to share who I am as a developer, creator, and human. I’ll be continuing to grow and expand this world. If you ever feel lost, this little text box will help guide your way. Let's get started. Go ahead and open the map.",
    world1: "This is the main map. It's separated into 4 territories. Each territory reveals a piece of my story. Some parts are polished. Others are still unfolding. Give each one a click for a brief description of what the destination has in store for you.",
    world2: "As they unfold, each territory will have hidden coins for you to collect, and items will be added to your inventory as you explore them, and the lands within them. Enjoy your travels.",
    // Territories
    north: "You ascend into the Realm of Code, where logic pulses through crystalline peaks — sharp mountains carved by precision and algorithms.",
    east:  "You follow a quiet path east, stepping into the Storyteller’s Path — a sacred grove where memory and meaning bloom among ancient trees.",
    south: "You journey south to the Creative Frontier, a sun-drenched shore where color spills like sunlight and creation knows no bounds.",
    west:  "You head west, into the Hidden Archives — a neon-lit labyrinth of glowing towers and forgotten code, where secrets hum behind flickering glass.",
    // Sub-lands (NL1–WL3)
    nl1: "The Algorithmic Hills. A retro sanctuary where logic flows like rivers and patterns bloom in neon — explore the foundations of how I think in code.",
    nl2: "The Framework Forge. Where tools are tempered and stacks are forged — dive into the tech I’ve learned and loved working with.",
    nl3: "The API Crossroads. Projects that connect, fetch, post, and play — this is where my code meets the wider world.",
    el1: "The Origin Grove. Step into the grove where I share the turning point that led me to shift careers and discover a passion for creative problem-solving through code.",
    el2: "The Learning Bridge. The most honest part of the journey — the stumbles, the mindset shifts, and the slow-building confidence of a self-taught dev.",
    el3: "The Reflection Tower. A high vantage point to see the path I’ve walked — and who I’ve become along the way.",
    sl1: "The Puzzle Workshop. Where logic gets playful — experiments, coding challenges, and brain-teasers that taught me more than I expected.",
    sl2: "The Expression Pavilion. A colorful canvas for creative code — pixel art, motion, and interface design that feels alive.",
    sl3: "The Concept Forge. Ideas in their rawest form — notes, prototypes, and sparks that might someday grow into full builds.",
    wl1: "The Forgotten Files. Code I nearly lost to time — old projects, revived and revisited with new eyes.",
    wl2: "The Easter Egg Vault. Just for fun — hidden interactions, jokes, and stray bits of personality you might stumble across.",
    wl3: "The Unfinished Abyss. Abandoned? Not quite. These are the ideas still waiting for their moment — code fragments and forgotten starts."
