# 🌐 The World of Tee

Welcome to my interactive portfolio — a vaporwave RPG-style world built to showcase my skills, story, and curiosity as a full-stack developer.

This isn't your typical portfolio. It's a journey through four unique territories, each revealing part of my growth as a programmer and creator — from problem-solving and backend logic to creative experiments and reflective storytelling.

🗺️ **Live Site**: [www.worldoftee.dev](https://www.worldoftee.dev)  
📌 **Trello Board** (dev roadmap & progress): [Click here](https://trello.com/b/Mp9ijkmme)  
📁 **This Repo**: The source code powering the world

## 🧩 Tech Stack (Phase 1 - Static Build)

- HTML / CSS / JavaScript (Modularized)
- Font Awesome, Custom Pixel Art, Retro UI Styling
- Vanilla JS State Management, Event Handling, Animations

## 🚧 Phase 2 - In Progress (Django + React Migration)

I'm currently transitioning the site into a dynamic Django + React hybrid. You can follow that journey on my [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/Mp9ijkmme).  
This includes:
- Rebuilding components as React modules
- Fetching content dynamically via Django backend
- Expanding interactivity and long-term maintainability

- 🔐 **Hidden Archives** and more... some parts still under construction (with love)
